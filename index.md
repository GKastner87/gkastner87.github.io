I am a Melbourne based Cloud Computing enthusiast. I have designed and driven many Microsoft Intune projects and many more migrations fron on-premise infrastructure to the cloud.

In 2021 I started working to solidify my Cloud Engineering skill set acquiring the first of my two badge to become an Azure Solution Archtiect Expert.

Currently I am learning how to code in Python and dabbling a bit in Linux, bash, kubernetes and I guess blogging.
