# Automating Software Updates with RSS Feeds and PowerShell 😎💻

## Effortlessly Stay Up-to-Date with the Latest Software Updates 🚀🔒

Imagine logging into work one morning, only to be greeted by the shocking news of zero-day vulnerabilities that have struck your organization. Panic sets in as the executives saw it on the news and are worried about what will we do.

But worry not! In this blog post, I'll show you how you can use the power of some clever scripting, package deployment tools, and an RSS feed to make light work of these challenges.

We'll explore a powerful script that not only helps you fix the immediate crisis but also equips you to handle any future morning outages, allowing you to relax and enjoy a well-deserved cup of coffee. 


### Let's Dive into the Script:

Our script starts by seamlessly retrieving an RSS feed from the esteemed Zero Day Initiative website. 
This feed is a treasure trove of essential information about software updates, including critical zero-day vulnerabilities. 

Using this data as our foundation, we then filter the updates based on specific software titles, including heavyweights like:
* Adobe Reader DC
* Microsoft Office
* Google Chrome, 
* Mozilla Firefox
* Microsoft Edge, 
**and Microsoft Windows**


But here's where our script truly shines. It leverages a range of impressive methods to flawlessly perform the updates. For updates related to Adobe Reader DC, Microsoft Office, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, we confidently utilize the 'winget' command-line tool. This tool, a Windows package manager, simplifies the installation and updating of applications like never before. 💪🔥

And let's not forget about our beloved Microsoft Windows updates. We deftly handle them using the mighty 'PSWindowsUpdate' module. This module empowers us with powerful cmdlets to interact with the Windows Update service and install updates with ease. It even includes intelligent options for automatic reboot if necessary, ensuring a seamless update experience. 🌟🔁
To keep you in the loop:

Our script diligently logs all the updates performed and writes them to a text file. With this log file at your disposal, you can effortlessly keep track of all the updates made on your system. 📝📆

## Conclusion:

Gone are the days of manually tracking and installing software updates. With our confident PowerShell script, you can effortlessly stay ahead of the game and ensure your system remains up-to-date with the latest security patches and bug fixes.
